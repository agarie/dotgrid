# dotgrid
a web app to generate dot-grid pdfs

This is a simple javascript application that generates a PDF side on the client side for either one or two pages of dot grid.

While the "interface" should be perfectly functional, there has been no effort to make it aesthetically pleasing. PRs beautifying the app are welcomed.

The output contains no watermarks or other such nonsense (a major problem with many dot-grid generators online), so if you find it useful star the project or post something on social media or otherwise just spread good vibes, man.
